///
/// It emits the same `onDirections(up, down, left, right)` shape as the
/// wobble stick, so the emulator screen can swap one for the other without
/// caring which is on screen.
///
/// **Not four separate buttons.** The C64 port is 8-way, and a cross of
/// independent [GestureDetector]s can only ever report the one it was
/// pressed on: a thumb resting between up and right would pick a single
/// winner, which loses diagonals -- and diagonals are how you jump forward
/// in most of the library. Instead the whole pad is one [Listener] that
/// tracks every active pointer and derives directions from where they are
/// relative to the centre, so resting on a corner presses both arms, and
/// sliding from one arm to the next changes direction without lifting off.
///
/// The dead zone is 18% of the radius, matching [WobbleJoystick] so the two
/// feel the same distance from neutral.
